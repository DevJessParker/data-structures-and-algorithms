# BT / BST


This file contains methods and traversal logic for Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees.

Notes:

- Traversal methods denoted as _walk() are recursive.

- BST Traversal includes PreOrder, InOrder (sorted array as results), and PostOrder

## Testing includes the following:

- Can instantiate an empty tree.
- Can add a left and right child node to a single root node.
- Can return from a PreOrder traversal.
- Can return from an InOrder traversal.
- Can return from a PostOrder traversal.
- Can find the max value in a tree.
- Can perform a breadth-first traversal of a tree.
